Exercise focused on the usage of media queries

This exercise involved updating pre-existing CSS with media queries responding to screen size, specifically to display a one-column view for phones, two-column designs for tablet views and four-column designs for larger screens like laptops or PCs, while also ensuring none of the images were stretched by browser resizing.
